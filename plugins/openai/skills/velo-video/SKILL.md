  This skill should be used when the user wants a video made with Velo, such as
  "make a video with Velo", "make an explainer / product demo / launch video",
  "turn this PDF (or deck, or screen recording) into a video", "make a video of this
  website", or "a video presented by an avatar". It also applies when following a
  Velo video ("check on my Velo video", "is my video ready?"), when Velo asks the
  user something (the brief, script approval, a voice or an avatar), when changing a
  draft, and when exporting or sharing a finished video.

# Making videos with Velo

Velo makes animated, narrated videos: explainers, product demos, training modules, pitch and launch videos, motion graphics and social clips. It works from a brief, a document, a screen recording, a public website or an AI presenter. Velo's own agent builds each video in a Velo chat; the Velo tools start it, relay the conversation and hand back the links.

The role here: write Velo a short brief that says what the video should achieve, show the user everything Velo says and asks, send back the user's answers and changes, and give them the links. Prompting Velo covers how to word what goes to Velo.

## How results read in chat

- Show every link Velo returns as a short markdown hyperlinks, such as [Open your video](url) or [Add your files](url). Never paste the raw URL, and never build or guess one.
- Keep IDs (`chat_id`, voice, avatar, option and scene IDs) out of chat. Use them only in tool calls.
- Use names and labels in every reply, confirmations included. Map the user's choices back to its ID when calling a tool.
- Say times and durations in plain words: "about 2 minutes", "an hour ago".
- Describe choices and next steps in everyday language.

## Start a video

1. **Add files first, if there are any.** A document, a recording, audio, images or a logo reaches Velo through `upload_file`.
   - Files the user attached in this conversation: pass them in `files`. Velo adds them directly and returns them in `files`. Any it couldn't take come back in `refused`, with the reason and an `upload_page_url` for adding them another way.
   - Any other file, such as one saved on the user's computer: call `upload_file` with no `files`. Give the user the returned `upload_page_url` as a link: they add the files in their browser and choose **Done uploading**. Wait until the user says they've uploaded the files, then call `list_files` with the returned `chat_id` to confirm the files arrived. It waits briefly while a file is still uploading.
   - To upload more files, call `upload_file` again with the same `chat_id` for a fresh link.
2. **Start it with `create_video`.** Write `message` as a short brief for Velo, 2 to 5 sentences, from the whole conversation:
   - Say what the video is about, what each attached file shows, and the conditions the user set (length, audience, tone, a script review first).
   - Describe files only by what they show ("the attached deck is our Q3 pitch"), never by where they came from or how they were fetched.
   - Shape it as "Prompting Velo" describes, from what the user said and gave. Leave out any script, scene list or facts dump of your own, and any detail the user left open. Velo's agent asks questions for what it needs.
   - If files were uploaded, pass that `chat_id`. The waiting files go with it. `files_left` says how many still wait for the next message; `files_refused` names any Velo couldn't take, with the reason.
3. **Pick the `flow`** that matches the request:

| flow | Use it for | Needs first |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auto` | A topic, a brief, or a public website (put the URL in `message`; Velo opens it in its own browser, so no recording is needed). | A `message` |
| `upload_pdf` | A video from a document (PDF, deck). | The document, through `upload_file` |
| `upload_recording` | Polishing a screen recording. | The recording, through `upload_file` |
| `record_yourself` | A video of the user talking. | That video, through `upload_file` |
| `generate_with_avatar` | A video presented by an AI avatar or user's clone. | Nothing |

- Pass `voice_id` or `avatar_id` only for one the user already chose (see Voices and avatars). Either one needs a `message` too.
- If the user wants to review the script before Velo builds the video, say so in `message`, even for a video without narration.
- Starting a video never approves a later script.

## Follow it

Call `get_video_status` with the `chat_id` to get status of the video.

The user can also work on the video in Velo itself. `since_you_looked` lists what changed there since your last look. Acknowledge what the user did there in one line, without asking or showing it again, and apply their next request to the video as it is now. A question Velo asked since then is the one thing to show them.

| status | What it means | Next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Working | Velo's agent is on it. `message` is its latest progress line. | Call `get_video_status`. |
| Needs your answer | Velo is waiting on the user: a question in `message`, a `pending_question`, or both. | Show it in full (see "When Velo asks"). |
| Needs your action | Velo's browser needs the user, for example to sign in to a site (`pending_action`). | Send the user to `preview_url`: they choose Take control, sign in if needed, then Resume agent. Never ask for their credentials in chat. Once they're back, check the status again; sending a message doesn't resume that browser. |
| Draft ready | A draft to watch at `preview_url`. `message` is Velo's reply and may ask something. | Show `message` and the link. Send answers or changes with `edit_video`. Export only when the user asks. |
| Finishing | The final video is rendering. `render_percent` says how far along. | Call `get_video_status`. |
| Done | The video is finished. `video_url` is its share page, present when sharing is on. | Give the user the links. |
| Out of credits | User has exhausted credits on Velo. `error.message` says why and how to resume. | See Credits. |
| Failed | The last step didn't finish. `error.message` says what to do next. | Show it. Trying again (`edit_video` or `export_video`) is the user's call. |

When `fix_attempt` is present, Velo is repairing a failed export on its own: keep following it.

## When Velo asks

Velo asks one step at a time: usually the brief, then the script, then the voice. An avatar video also asks who should be the presenter. A question can come at any status, Draft ready included, so read `message` on every result.

Present every question in plain chat text, whether it arrives in `message` or `pending_question`. Do not use native forms, question widgets or elicitation to collect the answer. Keep the full question: every choice (with its category), every optional field, and any script content. List every returned choice; don't trim the list.

### Questions in `message`

- Reply with `edit_video` and no `pending_question_id`, written for Velo in a few sentences with the context it needs, keeping every condition the user gave.
- If the user may have answered on the Velo page meanwhile, refresh `get_video_status` first: a question in `message` has no stale-question protection.
- A `message` that ends as truncated text "…" is partial. The full text is in the Velo chat at `preview_url`.

### `pending_question`

- Pass its `id` as `pending_question_id`, with the user's reply in `message` (as they gave it) or their choices in `answers`. Keys for `answers` come from `pending_question.answer_fields`; values are the chosen option IDs, the user's typed text, or null to skip an optional field. Partial answers are accepted.
- Ask optional fields in text and mark them optional. The user may answer or skip them; don't skip them silently.
- `free_text_ok: false` means a step only the Velo page can do, such as recording a take or choosing music. Send the user to `preview_url` and don't answer it with `edit_video`. Once they say it's done, check `get_video_status`.
- A result with `submitted: false` means that question was already answered or replaced, so nothing was sent; the result carries the latest state. Don't apply the old reply to the new question, and don't resend it without a question ID.

### The script

The script arrives as a `pending_question` of kind `script-review`, with every scene's narration in `scenes`.

- Show the user every scene, word for word, by scene number or title. Never summarize or shorten the narration.
- Wait for the user's explicit approval of this version. The first request, a voice choice or opening the voice library is not approval. Approving a script starts generating the narration.
- For a clear, unconditional approval, send `message="approve"` with the script's `pending_question_id`. If the reply includes changes or conditions, or is ambiguous, send it as the user gave it instead.

### Answering for the user

Answers and selections come from the user. Choose for them only when they explicitly ask, and then say so in `message` ("the user asked Velo to choose the voice").

## Voices and avatars

- `list_voices` and `list_avatars` list what the user can use, grouped as their own, shared in the workspace, then public. Show them in those groups, by name.
- A `pending_question` that asks for a voice or avatar carries its own choices: answer from those. Use the catalogs when Velo asks in `message` without choices, or when the user wants to choose or change one.
- `voices_url` opens Velo's voice library, where the user can listen before choosing. Opening it selects nothing.
- Send the pick with `edit_video`: the user's words in `message`, the ID as `voice_id` or `avatar_id` (an avatar can take a `voice_id` too), and the `pending_question_id` when it answers a question.
- Show only previews Velo supplies. Don't add stock or illustrative portraits.

## Changes, export and links

- Changes go through `edit_video` with the video's `chat_id`, worded as Prompting Velo describes. New files go through `upload_file` with that `chat_id` first; they go with the next `edit_video`.
- While the video is Working, `edit_video` returns `busy`. Follow it with `get_video_status` and send once the status changes.
- `export_video` renders the current draft into the finished video. Call it only when the user asks for the final video, then follow `get_video_status` until Done. Rendering is free; automatic repairs after a render error may use credits. Calling it again while rendering, or after a render, starts nothing.
- `preview_url` is the video's Velo chat, where the user watches the draft, answers and edits.
- `video_url` is the finished video's share page, not a file download.
- `list_videos` lists the user's videos, most recently active first, with each one's status and link. `status` narrows it to `draft` or `rendered`; pass `next_cursor` back as `cursor` for the next page. Use it to find a video the user mentions.

## Prompting Velo

Velo's video creation is intent and outcome driven: it works best from a simple explanation of what the finished video should achieve. Lead every `message` to Velo with that outcome in plain words, then add only what the user said, attached or connected. A detail the user didn't give stays out, or Velo is told to ask about it.

### A first brief

Start with the outcome; add the other points only when the user gave them.

- **The outcome:** what the finished video should achieve, and for whom. "A demo" is a topic; "a 4-step demo for new trial users that ends on a shared report" is an outcome.
- **Point Velo at the real thing:** the attached screenshots, document or recording (by what each shows), a URL, or a source the user connected in Velo, such as a knowledge base or an app, by name. Tell Velo to follow it.
- **Concrete actions over intent:** what the viewer sees happen on screen ("click Connect, choose a source, land on the dashboard"), not "demonstrate the integration".
- **Emphasis:** what the viewer must remember, and what to keep brief.
- **Gaps:** tell Velo to leave out or ask about anything the sources don't cover, so the video never shows a step that doesn't exist.
- **Style the user named:** narration (pace, tone, speaking to the viewer as "you" or staying neutral, a line per step or lighter narration) and visuals (subtle or punchy effects, cut pace, heavy or minimal on-screen labels, overall feel).

When a product video has no real material yet, suggest once that the user adds screenshots of the real UI, a help article or a URL: real screenshots are the fastest way to an accurate product video. Then start with what they have.

### A change request

A draft is usually close. Word each change so Velo places it exactly:

- **Lock what works:** end nearly every change with "Change only this; leave everything else exactly as it is."
- **Anchor three ways at once:** the narration words, the on-screen component, and where it sits. "When the narration says 'choose the report type', box the 'Report type' field" places it; "add a box near the top" doesn't. Quote narration from the script shown in this conversation, when there is one.
- **Time it to the narration:** an effect lands when the narration reaches its line, not at the start of the scene. Name the trigger line, and the timestamp when the user gave one.
- **Problem, target, and what to avoid:** what's wrong now, what right looks like, and the feel to rule out.

When a change aims at one moment and the user hasn't said which line, component or time, ask them before sending it.

### Bounding boxes and the cursor

Put these rules in any request that adds or changes a bounding box or the cursor:

- **Bounding boxes:**
  - Only one box on screen at a time: remove the previous one before the next.
  - Ground the box to the narration words, the component and where it sits on screen.
  - Size it to the component's actual height and width, built from the component's centre with 5px padding so it never overlaps the component.
  - Thin border, colour #242424, with no caption or label text.
  - Skip the box when the component is the only thing on screen.
- **Cursor:**
  - It follows the same boxes and narration.
  - It points to the component and never covers or overlaps it.

### Sample prompts

[references/prompt-library.md](references/prompt-library.md) has a sample prompt for each kind of first video (product demo, support how-to, training, feature announcement) and each kind of change (focus and emphasis, on-screen graphics, narration, captions, structure and timing). Read it when writing a brief or a change, and customise the closest sample to the request: keep what the user gave, and shorten or drop the rest.

## Credits

- Every action that Velo's agent performs costs credits. The user can see how many they have left in Velo's billing settings.
- `get_credit_balance` gives the workspace's remaining credits and plan; with a `chat_id`, also what that video has cost so far.
- Out of credits (the status, or an `insufficient_credits` error): the request is saved. A workspace owner adds credits in Velo's billing settings (other members ask an owner), then the user presses Continue in the Velo chat at `preview_url`. Don't send the request again.

## Errors and retries

A failed call returns `code`, `message` and `retryable`, plus `retry_after_seconds` and `link` when they apply.

- `create_video` and `edit_video` are not safe to retry: a call whose result was lost may have started. After an unclear failure, check `get_video_status` (or `list_videos` for a new video) before sending anything again. The same holds for `export_video`.
- `retryable: true`: nothing was started. Wait `retry_after_seconds`, then make the same call again.
- `busy`: Velo is still working on this video. Follow it and send once it's done.
- `input_rejected`: nothing was started, and `message` says what to change. A step that belongs on the Velo page comes with `link`, the page to finish it on.
- `not_found`: no video with that ID in this workspace. Check `list_videos`.
- `not_allowed`: this connection can't do that. The user reconnects Velo.
- `rate_limited`: wait `retry_after_seconds`, then retry.

## Avoid

- Writing a script, scene list or details the user left open into the brief.
- Filling a sample prompt's [brackets] with guesses: a timestamp, component, emphasis or style the user didn't give.
- Answering Velo's questions or approving a script on the user's behalf.
- Summarizing Velo's script or questions: show them whole.
- Inventing URLs, voices, avatars or previews.
- Calling `get_video_status` again on any status other than Working or Finishing.
